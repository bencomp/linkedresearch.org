                            <p>Whilst our <a href="/calls">call for contributions</a> is ongoing and online, sometimes we like to get together to talk about things in person. This may be regarding publishing our 'normal' research work according to Linked Research principles, or more specifically about the work we are doing to advance the understanding, tooling and culture that goes towards enabling Linked Research as a possibility for everyone.</p>

                            <p>If you know of or want plan a meetup or event of any size to talk about Linked Research or a related topic, let us know and we'll list it here.</p>
